# Bio

My name is Dana Simmelink. I have lived in Washington state my entire life. I went to EWU as a student from 1999 to 2004. Upon graduating, I was offered a job for a division at EWU. I stayed. Several job transitions and 15 years later, I am not a web and app developer in the IT Department at EWU.
